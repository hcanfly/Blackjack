# Blackjack

Blackjack is an iOS app written in Swift that implements a basic game of blackjack. It targets iOS 13 but I don't think there is any reason it couldn't be made to target a lower version if you create an older Xcode project (without scenes). It uses UIKit and implements the UI programmatically other than the default initial setup.
